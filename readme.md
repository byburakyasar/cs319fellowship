### Introduction

Our choice of project is Q-bitz. Q-bitz is a multiplayer game about building a pattern. The patterns are chosen randomly from a pile of    cards and players try to match the pattern using cubes. Cubes are identical to each other but each face of a cube is different from its     other faces. Depending on the specifics of the current round the player who builds the correct pattern fastest or the player who gets       closest to the correct pattern wins the round. Player with the most rounds won wins the game.

Our aim in this project is to make a Q-bitz game that has the same rules as the tabletop version. However, we are going to focus on user  experience, features and try to polish the end product as our attempt at making our project something more than the tabletop version.
