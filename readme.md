### Project Topic: Q-Bitz

### Description
Q-Bitz: Q-bitz offers three types of visual challenges, making it the perfect game for multiple playing styles. Round one of this game s all about speed as players race to manipulate their cubes to copy the pattern on the Q-bitz pattern card. In round two, players roll all of their cubes on the table like dice. Using the cubes as rolled (face up), players place as many cubes as possible in the tray to recreate the pattern shown on the card. Players race to re-roll all remaining unusable cubes until they roll the shapes that are needed to complete the pattern. Round three really tests brain power: players study the pattern card for ten seconds, flip it face down and then re-create the pattern from memory!
### Requirements
Our choice of project is Q-bitz. Q-bitz is a multiplayer game about building a pattern. The patterns are chosen randomly from a pile of cards and players try to match the pattern using cubes. Cubes are identical to each other but each face of a cube is different from its other faces. Depending on the specifics of the current round the player who builds the correct pattern fastest or the player who gets closest to the correct pattern wins the round. Player with the most rounds wins the game.

Our aim in this project is to make a Q-bitz game that has the same rules as the tabletop version. However, we are going to focus on user experience, features and try to polish the end product as our attempt at making our project something more than the tabletop version. The tabletop version of the game is multiplayer, but we will also add a singleplayer mode where the player will race against time and try to get as many correct cards as possible.
### Differences with real game
The tabletop version of the game is multiplayer, but we will also add a singleplayer mode where the player will race against time and try to get as many correct cards as possible.
